<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Lux (LUcid eXpect scripting) provides scripting with an
<code>Expect</code>-style execution of commands in a powerful but simple
fashion. See <a href="http://www.nist.gov/el/msid/expect.cfm" title="Expect homepage">Expect</a> for more info about the origin.</p>

<p>With Lux it is possible to</p>

<ul>
<li>simplify automated testing</li>
<li>control interactive programs by sending textual input to them and
using <a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/re.html" title="Erlang style regular expressions (re)">regular expression</a>s to ensure that their output matches the
expectations</li>
<li>perform detailed post mortem analyzis of test suite results</li>
<li>interactively debug and trace single test cases</li>
<li>get editor support for editing scripts by using the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs" title="Emacs text editor">Emacs</a> mode</li>
</ul>

<p>The tool is written in <a href="http://www.erlang.org/" title="Erlang programming language">Erlang/OTP</a> and requires its runtime
environment.</p>

<p>See the file <strong>lux.html</strong> for the full documentation or view it online
on <a href="https://github.com/hawk/lux/blob/master/doc/lux.md">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2>A sample script</h2>

<p>Here is an example of script <code>(lux/examples/intro.lux)</code>
which starts a couple of concurrent shells and sends text to them with
the <code>!</code> command and matches expected output with <code>?</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>[doc Test of single and multi line regular expressions]

# A global variable is accessible in all shells
[global file=removeme.txt]

[shell single]
  # The terminal echoes all input
  !echo foo
  ?foo

[shell multi]
  # bar is indented 4 characters
  !echo "foo"      &gt; $file
  !echo "    bar" &gt;&gt; $file
  !echo "fum"     &gt;&gt; $file
  !cat $file

  # The first double quote char defines the
  # first column of the multi line regexp
  """?
  foo
      bar
  fum
  """

# Let single be the active shell again
[shell single]
  ?^foo

# Cleanup is executed regardless of the script succeeds or fails
[cleanup]
  # Match of command exit status. Observe the double dollar sign.
  !rm -f $file
  !echo ==$$?==
  ?^==0==
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<h2>How to run the script</h2>

<p>Run a single script like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>/home/hm&gt; lux lux/examples/intro.lux

summary log       : /home/hm/lux_logs/run_2012_03_22_12_44_42/lux_summary.log

test case         : /home/hm/lux/examples/intro.lux
progress          : ..:..:....:.....:...:...:..:..:..:.....c......:...:...:..:....
result            : SUCCESS

successful        : 1
summary           : SUCCESS

file:///home/hm/lux_logs/run_2012_03_22_12_44_42/lux_summary.log.html

/home/hm&gt;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>In this run we got a (brief) progress report of the test case on
stdout and a link to a summary log containing (lots of) details.</p>

<h2>How to assemble the history of multiple runs</h2>

<p>In a nightly build environment it might be difficult to pinpoint when
a certain test case/suite started to fail. This process is greatly
simplified by running <code>lux</code> with the <code>--history</code> option as it will
assemble all test results as a timeline (interleaved with changeset
identities if provided with <code>--revision</code>).</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>/home/hm&gt; lux --revision svn_4711 --run jenkins_17 lux/examples
/home/hm&gt; lux --revision svn_4712 --run jenkins_20 lux/examples/intro.lux
/home/hm&gt; lux --revision svn_4712 --run jenkins_20 lux/examples/fail.lux
/home/hm&gt; lux --revision svn_4715 --run jenkins_22 lux/examples
/home/hm&gt; lux --history .
Assembling history of logs in /home/hm.......4 test runs...ok

<h2>Concepts</h2>

<p>A Lux script may succeed or fail, meaning that the system under
test is either conforming to or diverging from the expected
behavior. A Lux script may also end with an <strong>error</strong>, if the
Lux engine encountered some problem, and could not determine
whether the system under test conforms or not.</p>

<p>A Lux script consists of a sequence of instructions, mostly <code>send</code>
and <code>expect</code> operations, read in sequence from top to bottom. The test
case <strong>succeed</strong>s if all statements in the script are executed (or if an
optional success criteria matched). The test case <strong>fail</strong>s if there
is a <code>expect</code> operation that does not match within a given time (or if
an optional failure criteria matches).</p>

<p>Each test case should not depend on other test cases being executed
before (for example preparing something) or after (to clean up).
The <strong>cleanup</strong> procedure is an integral part of each test case.</p>

<p>Each <code>send</code> and <code>expect</code> operation is directed to one particular shell
(the <strong>active shell</strong>). Input is sent to the <strong>stdin</strong> stream of the
shell. The <strong>stdout</strong> and <strong>stderr</strong> streams of the shell are combined
to one single output stream. A Lux script can start and control
many concurrent shells, but at any time point only one is the active
shell which can evaulate new Lux statements.</p>

<p>It is possible to reference <strong>variables</strong> in the <code>send</code>, <code>expect</code>,
<code>my</code>, <code>local</code>, <code>global</code> and <code>config</code> statements, using the standard
shell <code>$var</code> or <code>${var}</code> notation. Note that the substitution is
performed by the Lux engine and not by the process running within
the shell. The variables are initially set to all <strong>environment
variables</strong>. But new settings can be added by using <code>[my var=val]</code>,
<code>[local var=val]</code> and <code>[global var=val]</code>. Each such variable setting
overrides existing settings of the same variable.</p>

<p>If no variable substitution should take place, the dollar sign must be
<em>escape</em>d with yet another dollar sign (<code>$</code>). For example, if the
actual value of an environment variable named <code>var</code> should be read
from the Bourne shell, the <code>$var</code> string cannot be substituted to
another value by the Lux engine. The string <code>$var</code> must be sent
literally to the shell even if the Lux engine happens to have
have a variable registered with that name. In order to achieve this
the <code>$var</code> must be escaped as <code>$$var</code>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/re.html" title="Erlang style regular expressions (re)">regular expression</a>s in <code>expect</code> statements may contain
<strong>sub-patterns</strong>. The values matching captured sub-patterns may be
accessed in the following variable assignments. For example if the
statement <code>?begin (.*) middle (.*) end</code> matches the actual shell output
<code>begin abc middle def end</code>. The captured sub-patterns can be accessed
as numbered variables: <code>[local foo=the vals are $1 and $2]</code> which will
assign the variable <code>foo</code> to the value "<code>the vals are abc and def</code>".
As in any language <a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/re.html" title="Erlang style regular expressions (re)">regular expression</a>s contains keywords. If the
output of a shell contains such a keyword and we want to match that,
the keyword must be escaped. Example of such keywords are any of
the characters <code>^$.?+*()[]{}|</code>.</p>

<p>The variable substitution mechanism makes it also possible to reuse
(parts of) generic scripts in several test cases. The (main) script
for these test cases may assign different values to variables and then
include a generic script that makes use of these variables.</p>

<p>See the documentation about <a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/re.html" title="Erlang style regular expressions (re)">regular expression</a>s in Erlang for
details about the regular expression dialect used in Lux. It is
an extended subset of <a href="http://www.pcre.org/" title="PCRE - Perl Compatible Regular Expressions">PCRE</a>.
<a name="script_syntax"/></p>

<h1>Script syntax</h1>

<p>The Lux script syntax is as follows. The <strong>first non whitespace</strong>
character on each line determines how it will be processed. Lines
beginning with a <code>#</code> are comments. It is recommended to use
indentation and comments to make the scripts more readable. The <strong>Lux
mode for <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs" title="Emacs text editor">Emacs</a></strong> (<code>lux/emacs/lux-mode.el</code>) is quite useful as it
simplifies the indentation and makes scripts more easy to read as it
provides different coloring for different types of language
constructs.</p>

<p>Lines beginning with <code>"""Char</code> are <strong>multi line quotes</strong>. The quote
ends with the next line beginning with <code>"""</code>. The opening quote and
closing quote must be in the same column of the script. The char right
after the first <code>"""</code> determines how the multi line quote will be
interpreted. The char is interpreted as a statement just like any of
the single line statement characters (so it can be e.g. <code>?</code>, <code>!</code>, <code>~</code>,
<code>#</code>, <code>-</code>, etc).</p>

<p>When multi line quotes are indented the leading whitespaces are
stripped from the quoted lines, up to but not including the column
of the double quote character, or to the first non-whitespace
character, whichever occurs first. In this process, a tab character
is treated as 8 space characters.</p>

<h2>Interacting with a shell</h2>

<p><strong>#String</strong> <br />
Inline style comment. The <code>#</code> must be the first non-whitespace
character on the line.</p>

<p><strong>!String</strong>  </p>

<p>A <code>send</code> operation. Sends a <code>String</code> to the <code>stdin</code> of the active
shell. Adds a <code>LF</code> at the end of the string. <code>String</code> may contain
references to variables using <code>$Var</code> or <code>${Var}</code>.</p>

<p><strong>~String</strong> <br />
Same as <code>!String</code>, but it does NOT add a <code>LF</code> at the end.</p>

<p><strong>?Regexp</strong> <br />
An <code>expect</code> operation which waits for a string matching a
<a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/re.html" title="Erlang style regular expressions (re)">regular expression</a> to appear on the shell output (either <code>stdout</code>
or <code>stderr</code>). If no matching output does appear within the timeout
period, the test case is considered as failed. See the <code>--timeout</code>
option. If no <code>Regexp</code> is given, the output streams (<code>stdout</code>,
<code>stderr</code>) are flushed. This means any output that has already been
received is discarded. See also the <code>--flush_timeout</code> and
<code>--poll_timeout</code> configuration parameters about customizing the
<code>?</code> behavior.</p>

<p><strong>??Template</strong> <br />
Like <code>?Regexp</code>, but more restricted as all regular expression
keywords are ignored. Variables are still substituted.</p>

<p><strong>???Verbatim</strong> <br />
Like <code>??Template</code>, but more restricted as no variables are substituted.
That is the string is matched as is.</p>

<p><strong>-Regexp</strong> <br />
Sets a failure condition <a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/re.html" title="Erlang style regular expressions (re)">regular expression</a>. If the given <code>Regexp</code>
ever matches, the test case is considered failed (no further
processing of the script). If no <code>Regexp</code> is given, the old failure
condition is reset (cleared). Typically used to match error messages.</p>

<p><strong>+Regexp</strong> <br />
Sets a success condition. If the given <code>Regexp</code> ever matches, the test
case is considered a success (no further processing of the script). If
no <code>Regexp</code> is given, the old success condition is reset (cleared).</p>

<p><strong>[endshell]</strong> <br />
An <code>expect</code> operation like <code>?</code>, but it waits for the <code>stdout</code> stream
of the shell to be closed. This means the shell has terminated.</p>

<h3>Meta statements</h3>

<p><strong>[</strong> <br />
Indicates the beginning of a meta statement. Meta statements are ended
on the same line with a <code>]</code>.</p>

<p><strong>[shell Name]</strong> Switches to the named shell, to make it active. In
case there is no such shell started yet, a new shell named <code>Name</code> is
created. By default a <code>/bin/sh</code> shell (Bourne shell) is started. See
the <code>--shell_wrapper</code>, <code>--shell_cmd</code> and <code>--shell_arg</code> configuration
parameters. The current working directory of a newly started shell is
the same as the dirname of the script file. The <strong>environment
variable</strong> <code>LUX_SHELLNAME</code> is set to <code>Name</code>. The shell prompt variable
<code>PS1</code> is set to <code>SH-PROMPT:</code> and the first printout of the prompt is
automatically matched in a expect manner in order to ensure that the
shell is ready for input. The <code>Name</code> may contain variables. Avoid
shell names beginning with <code>cleanup</code> as they may come in conflict with
the <code>[cleanup]</code> mechanism. The <strong>environment variable</strong>
<code>LUX_START_REASON</code> is initially set to <code>normal</code>. See also <code>[cleanup]</code>.</p>

<p><strong>[cleanup]</strong> <br />
is the cleanup marker. If the script is prematurely aborted due to
failure (or due to a matching success pattern) the remaining
statements in the file are normally skipped. But if the there is a
cleanup marker after the failing line (and this is the only
cleanup marker), the lines after the cleanup marker will also be
run in order to enable a controlled cleanup of leftovers. Such as
killing processes, removing files etc. When the cleanup marker is
evaluated, the running shells will be set into a non accessible mode
(<strong>zombie mode</strong>) and their failure and success patterns will be
reset (cleared). A brand new shell (called something beginning with
<code>cleanup</code>) will also be started. If the cleanup code causes a failure
the remaining statements (on that level) will be skipped.</p>

<p>Cleanup code in included files will always be run, even if the failure
occurred in the included file. This means that each file can take care
of its own failures. This does also apply on nested include files. On
the topmost level the automatically started shell will be called
<code>cleanup</code>, on the next level it is called <code>cleanup2</code>, on next level
<code>cleanup3</code> etc. The <strong>environment* variable</strong> <code>LUX_START_REASON</code> is
set to <code>normal</code> in most shells, but if the cleanup is run due to
premature failure or premature success it will be set to <code>fail</code> or
<code>success</code> respectively.</p>

<p><strong>[include FileName]</strong> <br />
Includes and runs the specified script at this point. The <code>FileName</code>
is relative to the currently executing script, unless given as an
absolute path. <code>.luxinc</code> is preferred as file extension. If the included
file contains a <code>[cleanup]</code> marker, the statements after that will be
evaluated in order to clean up unwanted side effects.</p>

<p><strong>[macro MacroName ArgName1 ArgName2 ...]</strong> <br />
  ... <br />
<strong>[endmacro]</strong> <br />
Declare a macro. The body of the macro consists of all lines up to
the next <code>[endmacro]</code> line. The scope of the arguments are local
within the macro. The arguments can be accessed via their names as
normal variables, such as <code>$ArgName1</code>. <code>[my Var=Value]</code> can be used to
assign temporary variables that only are valid within the macro. If a
macro switches to another shell it is good practice to switch back to
the calling shell before the end of the macro. One way of doing this
is to get the name of the active shell from the <strong>environment variable</strong>
<code>LUX_SHELLNAME</code> with <code>[my old=$LUX_SHELLNAME]</code> and later switch back
to the shell with <code>[shell $old]</code>. If the macro file contains a
<code>[cleanup]</code> marker, the statements after that will be evaluated in order
to clean up unwanted side effects.</p>

<p><strong>[invoke MacroName ArgVal1 ArgVal ...]</strong> <br />
Invoke a macro. The arguments are separated with spaces. Arguments
can be quoted with the double quote (<code>"</code>) character. Double quotes
and backslashes (<code>\</code>) must be escaped with a backslash.</p>

<p><strong>[loop Var Item1 Item2 ...]</strong> <br />
  ... <br />
<strong>[endloop]</strong> <br />
Declare a loop. The body of the loop consists of all lines up to the
next <code>[endloop]</code> line. The commands within the loop are repeated for
each item. For each iteration the loop variable <code>Var</code> is set to the
value of the current <code>Item</code>. The scope of the loop variable is the
same as a macro variable (defined with my). The <code>Item list</code> may
contain variables and these are expanded before the first
iteration. Items in the expanded list are separated with spaces. For
example <code>[loop colors blue red green]</code>.  When iterating over a set of
consecutive integers, such as <code>[loop iter 4 5 6 7]</code>, this can be
written as a range expression, like <code>[loop iter 4..7]</code>. In the logs
the iteration counter is represented as a negative line number. For
example "8:-2:10" would mean line 10 in the second loop iteration
where the loop starts at line 8.</p>

<h3>Variables</h3>

<p><strong>[local Var=Value]</strong> <br />
assigns a value to a variable that is local to the current
shell. <code>Value</code> may contain references to variables using <code>$Var</code>,
<code>${Var}</code> or <code>$N</code>, where <code>N</code> is an integer. <code>$N</code> refers to a captured
substring from the most recent <code>expect</code> operation. Subsequent <code>send</code>
operations may refer to this new variable in the same manner as
environment variables. In order to prevent variable substitutions and
keep a <code>$Var</code> string literally it must be escaped as <code>$$Var</code>. For
example this is needed when "true" environment variables needs to be
read. In order to read a variable like <code>$?</code> it must be written as
<code>$$?</code>.</p>

<p><strong>[global Var=Value]</strong> <br />
assigns a value to a global variable. Works like <code>[local]</code>, but the
variable setting is propagated to all shells. Global variables
may be set before any shell has been started.</p>

<p><strong>[my Var=Value]</strong> <br />
assigns a value to a macro variable. Works like <code>[global]</code>, but can
only be set and used in a macro. The variable setting is only valid
within the macro that assigns the variable.</p>

<h3>Builtin variables</h3>

<pre><code>_BS_      - backspace       (ASCII 8)
_TAB_     - tab             (ASCII 9)
_LF_      - line feed       (ASCII (10)
_CR_      - carriage return (ASCII 13)
_DEL_     - delete          (ASCII 127)
_CTRL_A_  - control a       (ASCII 1)
...
_CTRL_Z_  - control z       (ASCII 26)
N         - where N is an integer refering to a captured substring
</code></pre>

<h3>Builtin environment variables</h3>

<pre><code>LUX_SHELLNAME    - name of active Lux shell
LUX_START_REASON - reason for starting a shell (normal|fail|success)
PS1              - shell prompt variable set by Lux
</code></pre>

<h3>Miscellaneous statements##d</h3>

<p><strong>[doc String]</strong> <br />
<strong>[docN String]</strong> <br />
A test case slogan that will be displayed in the summary log. It
is also possible to document parts of a test case by specifying a
documentation level <code>N</code>. In that case the doc statement should look
like <code>[docN String]</code> where <code>N</code> is a integer. <code>doc2</code> would mean
that the documentation is on level 2. Doc strings can be extracted
from the scripts with the <code>--mode=doc</code> command line option.</p>

<p><strong>[timeout Seconds]</strong> <br />
sets the timeout for the current shell to the given number of
seconds multiplied with a configurated factor. By default the
multiplier is <code>1000</code>. For example, by setting the <code>--multiplier</code>
parameter to <code>2000</code> all timeouts will be doubled. The resulting
timeout value affects how long time <code>expect</code> operations will wait
before reporting failure. If time is not specified <code>[timeout]</code>, it
is reset to default the timeout specified with the <code>--timeout</code>
configuration parameter. The timeout value <code>infinity</code> means infinity.</p>

<p><strong>[sleep Seconds]</strong> <br />
waits given number of seconds before proceeding in the script. No
<code>multiplier</code> factor is applied.</p>

<p><strong>[progress String]</strong> <br />
Displays <code>String</code> on the <code>stdout</code> stream together with the rest of the
progress info.</p>

<p><strong>[config Var=Value]</strong> <br />
assigns a value to a <a href="#config_params">configuration parameter</a>. The
assignment takes place during parsing of the script file. The
configuration parameters in <strong>architecture specific files</strong> can be
overridden by <strong>command line options</strong>. For example <code>[config
timeout=2000]</code> can be overridden with <code>--timeout=4000</code>.  Explicit
<code>[config Var=Value]</code> settings in scripts takes however precedence over
settings in architecture specific files and command line options. See
the section <em>Configuration parameters</em> about valid configuration
parameters. Some config parameters can have multiple values, such as
<code>skip</code> and <code>require</code>. See their respective descriptions. See also the
configuration parameter <code>--config_dir</code> about the location of the
architecture specific files.
<a name="cmd_line_opts"/></p>

<h1>Command line options</h1>

<p>By default Lux is executing test suites and most of the command line
options affects that execution in different ways. There are however a
few auxiliary options that can be used to make Lux perform other
tasks.</p>

<ul>
<li>--reltool</li>
<li>--install</li>
<li>--make</li>
<li>--markdown</li>
<li>--annotate</li>
<li>--history</li>
<li>--mode</li>
</ul>

<h2>Script execution</h2>

<pre><code>lux [--mode Mode] [ConfigParam]... [File]...
</code></pre>

<p>Exit status is 0 if all test cases are successful and 1 otherwise.</p>

<p>See the section <a href="#config_params">Configuration parameters</a> about
script execution.</p>

<h2>Release management</h2>

<pre><code>lux --reltool [--root_dir RootDir]
lux --install [InstallDir] [--root_dir RootDir]
lux --make
lux --markdown
</code></pre>

<p><strong>--reltool</strong> <br />
Starts the graphical tool <a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/reltool/index.html" title="Erlang release management tool">Reltool</a> which enables inspection of
internal Lux application dependencies. It is disabled in the
standalone installation.</p>

<p><strong>--install [InstallDir]</strong> <br />
See <a href="#../INSTALL">installation</a>. Installs the application as a
standalone application on the <code>InstallDir</code> directory. <code>InstallDir</code>
must exist. If <code>InstallDir</code> is omitted only a dry run is performed. A
standalone installation is an installation that is self-contained and
contains a minimal Erlang runtime system. It is however not neccessary
to install Lux as standalone. If Erlang already is installed on the
system, Lux can make use of that runtime environment.</p>

<p><strong>--root_dir <code>RootDir</code></strong> <br />
Directs <a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/reltool/index.html" title="Erlang release management tool">Reltool</a> to use an alternate Erlang root directory instead
of the one that Lux currently executes. Affects <code>--install</code> and
<code>--reltool</code>.</p>

<p><strong>--make</strong> <br />
Simplified build that only relies on an installed Erlang/OTP system.
To be used with care on obscure platforms. See
<a href="#../INSTALL">installation</a>.</p>

<p><strong>--markdown</strong> <br />
Generates documentation for the debugger on <a href="http://www.daringfireball.net/projects/markdown" title="Markdown">Markdown</a> format.
This is used internally by doc/Makefile.</p>

<h2>Log management</h2>

<pre><code>lux --annotate LogFile
lux --history LogDir
</code></pre>

<p><strong>--annotate LogFile</strong> <br />
Transforms textual log files into HTML format and annotates Lux
scripts code with log events. The generated HTML file will get the
same name as <code>LogFile</code> but with a <code>.html</code> extension added. See also
the <a href="#config_params">configuration parameter</a> <code>--html</code>.</p>

<p><strong>--history LogDir</strong> <br />
Generates an HTML file which summarizes the history of all test runs,
by analyzing the <code>lux_summary.log</code> files located under <code>LogDir</code>. All
sub directories that not have a <code>lux.skip</code> file will be searched. The
file will be generated on the <code>LogDir</code> directory and is called
<code>lux_history.html</code>. Its behavior can be customized by using the
<code>--suite</code>, <code>--run</code> and <code>--revision</code> <a href="#config_params">configuration parameters</a>.
<a name="config_params"/></p>

<h1>Configuration parameters</h1>

<pre><code>lux [--mode Mode] [ConfigParam]... [File]...
</code></pre>

<p>Exit status is 0 if all test cases are successful and 1 otherwise.</p>

<p>Configuration parameters can be given as command line options, as
<code>[config Var=Value]</code> statements in a script or in a <strong>architecture
specific file</strong>.</p>

<p>An <code>architecture specific file</code> is a file with configuration
statements that only are valid for a certain
architecture/platform/system. The format of such a file is a subset of
a normal Lux script. Only configuration settings (<code>[config Var=Value]</code>).
See also the configuration parameters <code>--config_name</code> and <code>--config_dir</code>.</p>

<p>When a test suite (one or more test cases) is to be evaluated, the Lux
engine will determine the software/hardware signature of the system to
construct the name of a architecture specifiv file. If such a file
exists, its configuration settings will be extracted and used as base
for the entire test suite. These settings can however be overridden by
command line options and configuration settings in each test case.</p>

<p>The Lux engine evaluates one or more Lux files. Lux files has normally
<code>.lux</code> as extension. See the configuration parameter <code>--file_pattern</code>.
If a directory is given as input, all <code>.lux</code> files in that directory
and its sub directories are evaluated. The given files (files or
directories) are called test suites and the derived files (actual Lux
scripts) are called test cases. The configuration parameter <code>--skip</code>
can be used to conditionally skip test cases.</p>

<h2>Test case control</h2>

<p><strong>--mode Mode</strong> <br />
Mode can be one of :</p>

<ul>
<li><code>execute</code>  - evaluates the test cases. This is default.</li>
<li><code>validate</code> - parse all script files and configuration files and
           report syntax errors and warnings.</li>
<li><code>list</code>     - display a list of all test cases. One filename on
           each line.</li>
<li><code>doc</code>      - extract all <code>[doc]</code> strings and display them on a
           simple format. First the main file name is printed on
           an own line ending with a colon, followed by all doc
           strings, one on each line. The doc strings are indented
           with a tab char for each doc level.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>--file_pattern</strong> <br />
Specify file pattern for scripts to be executed when a directory is
given. Defaults to <code>.*.lux$</code>.</p>

<p><strong>--var</strong> <br />
Overrides environment variable settings. Each entry must be of the
form <code>var=value</code>.</p>

<p><strong>--config_name ConfigName</strong> <br />
Normally Lux figures out which system software/hardware it runs on,
but it can explicitly be overridden with the <code>ConfigName</code> option. The
<code>ConfigName</code> is used to read system architecture specific configuration
parameters from a file named <code>ConfigName.luxcfg</code>. By default <code>ConfigName</code>
is obtained from <code>uname -sm</code> where <code>ConfigName is set to</code>Kernel-Machine<code>.
This behavior can be overridden by adding a file named after the name of
the host (</code>hostname.luxcfg<code>) on the</code>ConfigDir` directory. </p>

<p><strong>--config_dir ConfigDir</strong> <br />
A directory where architecture specific connfiguration files may
reside. The format of the architecture specific files a subset of the
script format. Only <code>[config var=value]</code> statements are extracted from
the architecture specific file. The config settings in the
architecture specific file may be overridden by config settings in the
script files. Config settings in script files may be overridden by
command line options. Architecture specific files are by default
located in the subdirectory called <code>priv</code> in the <code>Lux</code> application.</p>

<p><strong>--skip Var</strong> <br />
<strong>--skip Var=Value</strong> <br />
Skip execution of the script if the given variable is set. This
option can be used multiple times, which means that it suffices
that one of the given <code>Var</code>s is set in order to skip the test
case. Typically <code>--skip</code> is used to test on presence of environment
variables. <code>--skip</code> is intended to be used as <code>[config skip=Var]</code>
or <code>[config skip=Var=Value]</code> statements within scripts. The
construction <strong>Var=Value</strong> is little more restrictive as it requires
that the variable is set to a certain value.</p>

<p><strong>--skip_unless Var</strong> <br />
<strong>--skip_unless Var=Value</strong> <br />
Skip execution of the script if the given variable NOT is set. This
option can be used multiple times, which means that it suffices
that one of the given <code>Var</code>s NOT is set in order to skip the test
case. Typically <code>--skip</code> is used to test on presence of environment
variables. <code>--skip_unless</code> is intended to be used as
<code>[config skip_unless=Var]</code> or <code>[config skip_unless=Var=Value]</code>
 statements within scripts. The construction <strong>Var=Val</strong> is little
more restrictive as it requires that the variable is set to a certain
value.</p>

<p><strong>--skip_skip</strong> <br />
<strong>--skip_skip=true</strong> <br />
Forces Lux to not care about <code>--skip</code> and <code>--skip_unless</code> settings.</p>

<p><strong>--require Var</strong> <br />
<strong>--require Var=Value</strong> <br />
Require that the given variable is set. The script will fail if
the variable not is set. This option can be used multiple times,
which means that all given Vars are required to be set.
Typically require is used to test on presence of environment
variables. <code>--require</code> is intended to be used as <code>[config require=Var]</code>
or <code>[config require=Var=Value]</code> statements within scripts. The
construction <strong>Var=Value</strong> is little more restrictive as it
requires that the variable is set to a certain value.</p>

<h2>Log control</h2>

<p><strong>--log_dir LogDir</strong> <br />
A directory where log files will be written. Default is <code>./lux_logs</code>.</p>

<p><strong>--html Html</strong> <br />
The <code>Html</code> option controls whether the logs should be converted to
HTML or not. It is an enum that denotes the outcome of the tests.
If the actual outcome is the same or higher than <code>Html</code> then the
logs will be converted. The possible outcome and their relative
values are as follows:</p>

<pre><code>success &lt; skip &lt; warning &lt; fail &lt; error &lt; never
</code></pre>

<p>The logs can be converted to HTML manually by using the command line
option <code>--annotate</code>.</p>

<p><strong>--tap LogFile</strong> <br />
A file where <a href="http://testanything.org/" title="Test Anything Protocol">TAP</a> events should be written. The file names
<code>stdout</code> and <code>stdin</code> are specially handled. They causes the log events
to be written to standard output respective standard error. Multiple
"files" can be given.</p>

<h2>Timeouts</h2>

<p><strong>--timeout Timeout</strong> <br />
The script expects the shell output to match given
<a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/re.html" title="Erlang style regular expressions (re)">regular expression</a>s. But the output must be received within a
given time limit. The <code>Timeout</code> specifies how long it will wait before
the script fails. The <code>Timeout</code> defaults to <code>10000</code> milli seconds
(<code>10</code> seconds). This <code>Timeout</code> can be overridden by the statement
<code>[timeout Timeout]</code> in the script itself.</p>

<p><strong>--cleanup_timeout CleanupTimeout</strong> <br />
When the script reaches the <code>[cleanup]</code> marker, the ordinary
<code>Timeout</code> will be set to <code>CleanupTimeout</code>. The <code>CleanupTimeout</code>
defaults to <code>100000</code> milli seconds (<code>100</code> seconds).</p>

<p><strong>--multiplier Multiplier</strong> <br />
In order to be able to run the tests on very slow hardware,
the <code>Multiplier</code> can be used. Each time a timer is initiated
(except sleep) its value is multiplied with the <code>Multiplier</code>
value. <code>Multiplier</code> is an integer and defaults to <code>1000</code>. For
example, by setting the <code>Multiplier</code> to <code>2000</code> all timeouts will
be doubled. <code>--multiplier</code> is intended to be set in architecture
specific files to provide different settings on different systems.</p>

<p><strong>--suite_timeout SuiteTimeout</strong> <br />
If the duration of the execution exceeds the <code>SuiteTimeout</code>, it
is aborted. The <code>SuiteTimeout</code> defaults to <code>infinity</code>, but can
be any positive integer value in the unit of milli seconds.</p>

<p><strong>--case_timeout CaseTimeout</strong> <br />
If the the duration of a single test case exceeds the
<code>CaseTimeout</code>, it is aborted. It can be any positive integer
value in the unit of milli seconds or <code>infinity</code>. The default
is <code>300000</code> (5 minutes).</p>

<p><strong>--flush_timeout FlushTimeout</strong> <br />
All output from a shell is buffered and matched against
<a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/re.html" title="Erlang style regular expressions (re)">regular expression</a>s. It can however explicitly be flushed by
the script. When this is done, the engine first waits a while
before it discards the output. How long it waits is controlled
by <code>FlushTimeout</code>. It defaults to <code>0</code>. If you want to experiment
with it, <code>1000</code> milli seconds (1 second) can be a resonable value.</p>

<p><strong>--poll_timeout PollTimeout</strong> <br />
When the Lux engine receives output from a shell it will
wait in <code>PollTimeout</code> milli seconds for more output before it
tries to match it against any <a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/re.html" title="Erlang style regular expressions (re)">regular expression</a>s. It defaults
to <code>0</code>. If you want to experiment with it, <code>100</code> milli seconds
(1/10 second) can be a resonable value.</p>

<h2>History control</h2>

<p><strong>--suite Suite</strong>  </p>

<p>The Suite is used for bookkeeping a name which later is used for
printing out the history of test runs. See the
 <a href="#cmd_line_opts">command line option</a> <code>--history</code>.</p>

<p><strong>--run RunId</strong> <br />
The <code>RunId</code> is used for bookkeeping a name which later is used for
printing out the history of test runs. See the
 <a href="#cmd_line_opts">command line option</a> <code>--history</code>.</p>

<p><strong>--extend_run</strong> <br />
<strong>--extend_run=true</strong> <br />
Combines two runs into one. The summary log of an earlier run is
extended with the outcome of the new run. <code>--log_dir</code> can be given
explicitly. If not, the symbolic <code>latest_run</code> link is used to find
a suitable log directory.</p>

<p><strong>--revision Revision</strong> <br />
The <code>Revision</code> is used for bookkeeping a repository revision
(changeset) which later is used for printing out the history of test
runs. See the <a href="#cmd_line_opts">command line option</a> <code>--history</code>.</p>

<h2>Debugging and tracing</h2>

<p><strong>--progress ProgressLevel</strong> <br />
<code>ProgressLevel</code> can be one of <code>silent</code>, <code>brief</code>, <code>doc</code>, <code>compact</code> and
<code>verbose</code>. It defaults to <code>brief</code> which means that single characters
are printed to stdout. <code>doc</code> is like <code>brief</code> but in this mode doc
strings are also printed on stdout. <code>compact</code> means that an event
trace is printed on stdout. It is the same event trace that is written
to the <code>event log</code>. verbose contains the same info as compact but is
more readable (the newlines are expanded). <code>silent</code> means that no
progress at all is printed. The <code>brief</code> characters have the following
meanings:</p>

<pre><code>   . - a new row in the script is being interpreted
   : - output is being received from a shell
   c - the cleanup marker
   z - is printed out each second while sleeping
   ( - beginning of a macro or an include file
   ) - end of a macro or an include file
   ? - waiting for shell output. Can be preceded with lineno of potential error.
</code></pre>

<p>In addition to these characters, line number are printed when there is
a failure or a potential failure.</p>

<p><code>[progress String]</code> can also be used to display progress info.</p>

<p>The <code>ProgressLevel</code> can also interactively be changed via the debugger.</p>

<p><strong>--debug</strong> <br />
The debugger is always available (even without this flag) and waiting
for input on the <code>stdin</code> stream. With the <code>--debug</code> flag the debugger
is attached to the script before the first line is executed and
waiting for input. The command <code>attach</code> (<code>a</code> for short) attaches the
debugger to the script and pauses its execution. The command
<code>progress</code> (<code>p</code> for short) toggles the verbosity level between <code>brief</code>
and <code>verbose</code>. Use the debugger command <code>help</code> to get more info about
the available commands. See also the section <a href="#debugging">debugging and tracing</a>.</p>

<p><strong>--debug_file SavedFile</strong> <br />
Loads the commands in the <code>SavedFile</code> before the first line in the
script is executed. See the debugger command <code>save</code> and <code>load</code> for
more info. The format of the <code>SavedFile</code> is very simple and may be
manually edited. For example <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> may be convenient
commands to add to such a file.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

<p><strong>--shell_cmd Cmd</strong> <br />
<strong>--shell_args Arg</strong>  </p>

<p>These parameters controls which program that will be started when a
script starts a shell. By default <strong><code>/bin/sh -i</code></strong> is started as
<code>--shell_cmd</code> and <code>--shell_args</code> defaults to <code>/bin/sh</code> and <code>-i</code>
respectively. <code>--shell_args</code> is a bit special in how this parameter
is treated by Lux.</p>

<p><strong>--shell_prompt_cmd PromptCmd</strong> <br />
<strong>--shell_prompt_regexp PromptRegExp</strong>  </p>

<p>When Lux starts a shell the prompt is set to <strong><code>SH-PROMPT:</code></strong> by
default. In Bourne shell, which is the default shell, the variable
<code>PS1</code> is used to set the prompt. This is obtained by using the command
<code>export PS1=SH-PROMPT:</code> followed by an explicit match of the prompt
using the regexp <code>^SH-PROMPT:</code>. This behavior can be overridden by
using <code>--shell_prompt_cmd</code> and <code>--shell_prompt_regex</code> respectively
when using more exotic shells.</p>

<p><strong>--shell_wrapper [Executable]</strong>  </p>

<p>In order to get the terminal settings to work properly in advanced
interactive cases such as tab completion etc., the shell needs to be
executed in a <strong>pseudo terminal</strong>. This can be accomplished by using a
wrapper program that sets up the terminal correctly. The wrapper
program takes the name of the shell program with arguments (by default
<code>/bin/sh -i</code>) as argument and is expected to first configure the
terminal and then start the shell.</p>

<p>The <code>lux/priv/runpty</code> is an <code>Executable</code> that handles such terminal
settings and it will be used by default (if it has been built
properly). It is however possible to use a custom wrapper program by
using the <code>--shell_wrapper</code> parameter.</p>

<p>It is also possible to use no shell wrapper at all by omitting the
<code>Executable</code> value (or simply set it to the empty string "").</p>

<p><strong>--line_term Chars</strong> <br />
Specify the character sequence added to the end of lines sent to
a shell. It defaults to <code>\n</code>.
<a name="logs"/></p>

<h1>Logs</h1>

<p>Lux will create a new directory for each test run. By default the log
files are generated under <code>./lux_logs/run_yyyy_mm_dd_hh_mm_ss</code> where
<code>run_yyyy_mm_dd_hh_mm_ss</code> is a unique directory name generated from
the current time. A symbolic link called <code>./lux_logs/latest_run</code> will
also be created. It refers to the newly created log directory for the
latest run. If the <a href="#config_params">configuration parameter</a>
<code>--log_dir LogDir</code> is set, the given path will be used instead and no
symbolic link will be created.</p>

<p>Each test run will result in the following log files:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>lux_summary.log</strong> which contains information about the outcome of
each test case and paths to test case logs.</li>
<li><strong>lux_config.log</strong> which contains all configuration settings common
for the test suite.</li>
<li><strong>lux_result.log</strong> which contains a condensed summary of the outcome.</li>
<li><strong>lux.tap</strong> is a <a href="http://testanything.org/" title="Test Anything Protocol">TAP</a> compliant log file.</li>
</ul>

<p>For each test case several logs are written:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>$CASE.event.log</strong> contains every internal event. Such as which
statements that has been executed, output from shells etc.  This is
the main source for information for detailed information about the
outcome of a test case.</li>
<li><strong>$CASE.config.log</strong> contains configuration settings for the test case.</li>
<li><strong>$CASE.$SHELL.stdin.log</strong> contains the raw input to the
shells. There is one such log per shell.</li>
<li><strong>$CASE.$SHELL.stdout.log</strong> contains the raw output from the
shells. There is one such log per shell.</li>
<li><strong>$CASE.orig</strong> is a copy of the test script.</li>
</ul>

<p>The summary log, result log, event logs and config logs are by default
processed and converted to HTML in order to make them easier to
read. This can be controlled with the <code>--html</code> <a href="#config_params">configuration
parameter</a>. The html logs are called
<code>lux_summary.log.html</code> and <code>$CASE.event.log.html</code> respectively.</p>

<p>The outcome of multiple test runs can be assembled in a <strong>history
log</strong>. This log is very useful when Lux is used in a daily build
environment and some test cases suddenly starts to fail. By using the
time line in the history log it can be possible to determine which
checkin to the repository that introduced the first failure. See the
<code>--history</code> <a href="#cmd_line_opts">command line option</a>. Its behavior can be
customized by using the <code>--suite</code>, <code>--run</code> and <code>--revision</code>
<a href="#config_params">configuration parameters</a>.
<a name="debug_cmds"/></p>

<h1>Debugger for Lux scripts</h1>

<p>When <code>lux</code> is started with the <code>--debug</code> option, the debugger
will attach to the script before its execution has started. An
optional file with saved commands may be processed at this stage.
The debugger can also be attached to the script in the middle of
the execution by entering the command "attach" (or an abbreviation
of the command) and pressing the enter key.</p>

<p>Several parameters has a lineno as parameter see <code>help lineno</code>.</p>

<p>Blank command lines implies that the previous command is repeated.
If no command has been entered yet, the command <code>help</code> is assumed.</p>

<p>Commands may be abbreviated. Use the help command (for example
<code>help help</code> to get more detailed descriptions of the commands.</p>

<h2>Available commands: </h2>

<ul>
<li>attach   - attach to script and pause its execution</li>
<li>break    - set, delete and list breakpoints</li>
<li>continue - continue script execution</li>
<li>help     - display description of a command</li>
<li>tail     - display log files</li>
<li>list     - list script source</li>
<li>load     - load file with debug commands</li>
<li>next     - execute next command. A multiline command counts as one command.</li>
<li>progress - set verbosity level of progress</li>
<li>quit     - exit lux in a controlled manner. Runs cleanup if applicable. </li>
<li>save     - save debug state to file</li>
<li>skip     - skip execution of one or more commands. A multiline command counts as one command.</li>
</ul>

<h2>lineno parameter</h2>

<p>Several commands has a lineno as parameter. It is a string which
is divided in several components. The components are separated
with a colon and are used to refer to line numbers in include
files, macros and loops. The first component is a bit special.
It may be a file name or a line number. The file name may be
abbreviated.</p>

<p>Assume that there is a file called main, which includes a file
called outer at line 4 and the file outer includes a file called
inner at line 12.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples of how lineno can be used:</p>

<ul>
<li>3       - line 3 in current file</li>
<li>main    - any line in file main</li>
<li>m:3     - line 3 in file main</li>
<li>:3      - line 3 in file main</li>
<li>inner   - any line in file inner</li>
<li>outer   - any line in file outer</li>
<li>o:12    - line 12 in file outer</li>
<li>4:12:6  - line 6 in file inner if it is included
        on line 12 in outer and outer is included
        on line 4 in main.</li>
</ul>

<p>attach to script and pause its execution</p>

<p><strong>Parameters:</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>no parameters</li>
</ul>

<h2>break [lineno] [duration]</h2>

<p>set, delete and list breakpoints</p>

<p>When a breakpoint is set it may either be normal (default)
or temporary. The difference between them is that normal
breakpoints remains after break while temporary breakpoints
are automatically deleted when they have been used once.
delete means that the breakpoint immediately is removed.</p>

<p>Without parameters, all breakpoints are listed.</p>

<p><strong>Parameters:</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>lineno   - lineno in source file; lineno  </li>
<li>duration - controls the duration of the breakpoint; enum(normal|temporary|delete)  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Parameters:</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>command - debugger command; string  </li>
</ul>

<h2>tail [index] [format] [n_lines]</h2>

<p>display log files</p>

<p>With no argument, the names of the log files will be listed.
Each one is preceeded by its index number and optionally a
star. Star means that the log has been updated since the
previous status check. Use the index to display a particular
log. Such as "t 5" for the event log. Press enter to
display more lines. n_lines can be used to override that
behavior andonly display a fixed number of lines regardless
of the command is repeated or not.</p>

<p><strong>Parameters:</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>index   - log number; 1 >= integer =&lt; infinity  </li>

<li>n_lines - fixed number of lines; 1 >= integer =&lt; infinity  </li>
</ul>

<h2>list [n_lines] [lineno]</h2>

<p>list script source</p>

<p>If no "lineno" is given, the listing will start from the
current line or from the latest given "lineno" if no other
commands have been given in between.</p>

<p><strong>Parameters:</strong>  </p>

<h1>Examples</h1>

<p>To be written...<a name="../INSTALL"/></p>

<h1>Installation</h1>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>The following software is required:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The tool <strong>Lux</strong> is implemented with <strong><a href="http://www.erlang.org/" title="Erlang programming language">Erlang/OTP</a></strong> and its
runtime system must be installed in order to build the tool. Install
<code>Erlang/OTP</code> from <a href="http://www.erlang.org/" title="Erlang programming language">source</a> or use <a href="https://www.erlang-solutions.com/downloads/download-erlang-otp" title="Prebuilt packages at Erlang Solutions">pre-built packages</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install erlang
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Once <code>Lux</code> has been installed, it will be self-contained and does
not need a separate <code>Erlang/OTP</code> runtime system any more.</p></li>
<li><p>The documentation is pre-built. Re-generation of the documentation
requires <strong><a href="http://www.daringfireball.net/projects/markdown" title="Markdown">Markdown</a></strong>.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>If you have cloned the source from <code>github.com</code> and want to build the
tool using <code>configure</code> and <code>make</code> there is no <code>configure</code> script. Then
you need to create it with</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>autoconf
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Vanilla configure, build and install with</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>./configure
make
make install
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This will imply that <strong>Lux</strong> will be installed on <code>/usr/local/lux</code> and
that custom architecture configuration will be read from
<code>/usr/local/lux/lib/lux-$(VSN)/priv</code>.</p>

<p>Install on specific directory <code>/foo/bar</code> with</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>./configure
make
DESTDIR=/foo/bar make install
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>alternatively</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>./configure --prefix=/foo/bar
make
make install
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Install on directory <code>/foo/bar</code> and read custom architecture
configuration from <code>/etc/lux</code> with</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>./configure
make
DESTDIR=/foo/bar ETCDIR=/etc/lux make install
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>alternatively</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>./configure --prefix=/foo/bar --sysconfdir=/etc/lux
make
make install
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<h2>Obscure platforms</h2>

<p>On "obscure platforms" which have <code>Erlang/OTP</code> but lacks
<code>autotools</code>, make etc. it is still possible to build with</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>bin/lux --make
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>and install with</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>bin/lux --install DestDir
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The given InstallDir will contain the lux tool as well as a stripped
Erlang runtime system. It is possible to move the entire standalone
system from InstallDir to another location without any
re-installation.</p>

<p>The standalone tool can be started with</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>DestDir/bin/lux
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<h2>Re-build the documentation</h2>

<p>Simply do</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>cd doc
make
firefox ../lux.html
</code></pre>

<p><a name="../AUTHORS"/></p>
